This project is in progress as I learn Ruby on Rails based on [this course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg) from Free Code Camp.


## GIT Cheat Sheet

* git add .

Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.

* git commit -m "First commit"

Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD1' and commit and add the file again

* git remote -v

Verifies the new remote URL

* git push -u origin master

Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
